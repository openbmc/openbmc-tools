# Greppable CLA signer list

This file is intended for maintainers to use when checking whether committers
have signed the obligatory CLA.

To update the list, add new names to cla-signers and then run update-cla.sh.
Before running the script, make sure the header (modify date) is still the first
line in the file. update-cla will sort and dedupe the names and update the
timestamp.
