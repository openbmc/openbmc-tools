Maybe we \"weight\" the percentile based on point count?\n\n\nFWIW, my use of this ranking is only really applied for the top 20 or so people on the list, so they can say \"I\u0027m the #8 contributor in the world to openbmc\" on their yearly review, and get credit for their hard work.  At this point, I\u0027m not using it for analyzing the lower 50% of reviewers.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e There is a lot of noise in the Gerrit data because there are people who only operate in commits that are related to just a single company or people who seem to regularly give a token +1 without any feedback.
