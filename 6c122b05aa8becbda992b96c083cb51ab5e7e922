For the \"Highly Productive\" number we only look at percentile within qualified members (ie. they have to have over 15 pts).  With the way you\u0027re calculating the metric, someone with a single commit ends up being listed as in the 40th percentile and someone who did exactly 1 review is in the 21st perentile.\n\nThere is a lot of noise in the Gerrit data because there are people who only operate in commits that are related to just a single company or people who seem to regularly give a token +1 without any feedback.  So, when we pull the data and find all the \"active users\" there are a lot more than those who are qualified.",
