README for build script

This script is used to simplify the build process for rpms. It must be run with root privileges.
simply run the script with the current directory structure. It will prompt the user for the version
and the release number to use. It will then create a tarball for the rpm content
and then build the rpm. Once complete the new rpm can be found in /tmp/openbmctool-{version-release)/
directory.
