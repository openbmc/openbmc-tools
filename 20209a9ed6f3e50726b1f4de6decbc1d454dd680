      "message": "I originally thought the \"destination\" in a method call and the \"sender\" in a method response might not exactly match (i.e. requested service name versus unique name). But I tested again by just using the reliable method and it seems in most cases those two should match so I removed the unreliable method (which only looks at the serial number).\n\ndbus-pcap is fine, because the problem only arises when dbus-pcap\u0027s outputs are used as outputs. So it is a problem in processing dbus-pcap\u0027s output (namely, dbus_pcap_loader.js). dbus-pcap prints the contents of the packet and does not need to worry about matching method calls and method responses. Method calls and responses are printed separately by dbus-pcap.",
