# The OpenBMC Tools Collection

The goal of this repository is to collect the two-minute hacks you write to
automate interactions with OpenBMC systems.

It's highly likely the scripts don't meet your needs - they could be
undocumented, dysfunctional or utterly broken. Please help us improve!

## Repository Rules

* _Always_ inspect what you will be executing
* Some hacking on your part is to be expected

## If you're still with us

Then this repository aims to be the default destination for your otherwise
un-homed scripts. As such we are setting the bar for submission pretty low,
and we aim to make the process as easy as possible.

## Sending patches

Please use gerrit for all patches to this repository:

* [Gerrit](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/) Repository

Do note that you will need to be party to the OpenBMC CLA before your
contributions can be accepted. See [Gerrit Setup and CLA][1]
for more information.

## What we will do once we have your patches

So long as your patches look sane with a cursory glance you can expect them to
be applied. We may push back in the event that similar tools already exist or
there are egregious issues.

## What you must have in your patches

We don't ask for much, but you need to give us at least a
[Signed-off-by](https://developercertificate.org/), use SPDX markers in your
source files and put your work under an Apache 2.0 compatible license.

## How you consume the repository

There's no standard way to install the scripts housed here, and adding parts of
the repository to your PATH might be a bit of a dice-roll. We may also move or
remove scripts from time to time as part of housekeeping. It's probably best to
copy things out if you need stability.
